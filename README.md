# clumsy-bot

## Introduction

My first discord bot

If you want to add this bot to your server, [Click HERE](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769546560089620550&scope=bot)

The bot hasn't been deployed yet. So, it won't work until I run it locally.

> README will be updated once the bot is deployed

## Commands

- The word `Bye` *(case insensitive)*, in any sentence or as a single word will return this `https://tenor.com/view/bye-slide-baby-later-peace-out-gif-12999722` gif

- `!gif <name>` command will give a random gif related to the given name

- `!server` will return the server's name and Total memebers in it
